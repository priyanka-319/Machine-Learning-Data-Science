Under this project, I used various Python libraries such as NumPy for computation, pandas for manipulating data frames, Scikit for machine learning, matplotlib for visualization. The aim was to explore the venues in different Boroughs of London using Foursquare API and K-means clustering to get insights on popular venues in different areas. Also plotted the data on choropleth map. The project also analysed the housing sales price for given region.
