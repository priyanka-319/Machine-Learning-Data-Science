**Venue Data & Property-Price Trend Analysis of London**
Under this certification, I used various Python libraries such as NumPy for computation, pandas for manipulating data frames, Scikit for machine learning, matplotlib for visualization. The aim was to explore the venues in different Boroughs of London using Foursquare API and K-means clustering to get insights on popular venues in different areas. Also plotted the data on choropleth map. The project also analysed the housing sales price for given region.

Explored popular venue categories and property prices in different boroughs using Foursquare API and K-means clustering algorithm to help investors make informed decision to yield maximum benefits on minimum investment.

**Credit Card Fraud Detection Predictive Models**
- Anomaly Detection using Logistic Regression, Isolation Forest Algorithm, and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) Algorithm and measured model accuracy using classification report, accuracy score and confusion matrix.

**Airbnb Rental Price Prediction for NYC**
- Performed extensive EDA on the NYC Airbnb open data and predicted rental prices using various regression algorithms and compared performance of models using root-mean-squared error (RMSE).
